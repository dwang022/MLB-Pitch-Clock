## Abstract
New this season, the MLB implemented a pitch clock that consists of a 15-second timer between pitches with the bases empty and a 20-second timer between pitches with runners on base. The pitcher must begin his delivery before the clock expires, or else he will be assessed with an automatic ball. The goal of the pitch clock is to speed up the game, and it has successfully done so as the average game length is down about 30 minutes compared to last season, to roughly 2 hours and 38 minutes per game. This rule was highly controversial, as many pitchers were publicly against the pitch clock, while others argued that the rule would disrupt the game's natural flow. However, two months into the season, the pitch clock has looked like a successful change. Using data from Baseball Savant, I will analyze how the pitch clock has impacted the performance of pitchers with the slowest tempos from previous years.
